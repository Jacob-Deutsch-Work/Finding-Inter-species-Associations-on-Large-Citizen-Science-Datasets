To use the code it's pretty simple. Just change DB_FILE_NAME to match the file name of your csv. Then there are other parameters you can mess around with within the first 30 lines of code or so.

Your csv just needs to follow the format of the csv I've uploaded as an example.

You'll also need to install various packages and libraries if you don't already have them. Just run the code, it should barf if you don't have one of them, look up how to install that one, and carry on.

I would try a smaller dataset at first to see how it does on your machine. The results are truly much better with larger datasets though, so the results you could get on a small dataset won't be that useful.
